# Neural Style Transfer

## Overview

This project implements Neural Style Transfer using PyTorch. Neural Style Transfer (NST) is an artistic technique that combines the content of one image with the style of another image to create visually appealing images.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `main.py`: Python script containing the NST implementation.
- `crop1.jpg`: The content image used for NST.
- `crop3.jpg` and `crop4.jpg`: Style images used for NST.
- `generated_images/`: Directory where generated images are saved during the training process.
- `README.md`: This README file providing an overview of the project.

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have the required libraries and dependencies installed.
2. Run `main.py` to start the NST process. You can specify different content and style images by updating the file paths in the script.
3. Generated images will be saved in the `generated_images/` directory.

Feel free to customize and experiment with the hyperparameters and images to create your own artistic style transfers!
